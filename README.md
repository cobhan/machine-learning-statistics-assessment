<h2>Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment - December 2019</h2>
This project is based on the well-known Boston House Prices dataset and the Python packages scipy, keras and jupyter notebook.

The project is split into three parts:
<ul><li><strong>Describe:</strong> Create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset.</li>
<li><strong>Infer:</strong> Add a section where you use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that arenâ€™t.</li>
<li><strong>Predict:</strong> Use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.</li></ul>
